# GEAK external orchestrator contract (`interface/run_e2e.py`)

`interface/` is the only surface an external orchestrator (for example, Hyperloom)
touches. Everything volatile about the e2e workflow (the `e2e_workflow.js` arg
names and the selected agent backend's invocation details) is hidden behind one command and two JSON
files. The result schema is versioned so callers can distinguish contract
changes while the workflow evolves internally.

## Command

Run the external orchestrator entry point as follows.

```bash
python interface/run_e2e.py <handoff.json> <result.json> [--dry-run]
```

- Exit code `0`: `result.json.status` is `ok` or `no_gain`.
- Exit code `1`: a crash; `result.json.status == "error"` with an `error` field.
- Exit code `2`: bad usage or unreadable handoff.
- `--dry-run`: print the mapped `e2e_workflow.js` args and the prompt and
  exit `0` (no GPU work). Use this to validate the mapping in CI.

Discovery: the installer should export `GEAK_E2E_RUNNER` pointing at this
file (`$GEAK_ROOT/interface/run_e2e.py`) so the caller has a single
hard-coded handle.

The fast-path artifacts live under `<exp_root>/geak_e2e_moe_int4/`
(`baseline/`, `validation/final/`, `final/` bundle, `director_e2e_validation.json`).

### Agent backend

Set `GEAK_AGENT_BACKEND=claude|codex`; the default is `claude`. The Claude SDK/CLI path is unchanged.
The Codex path requires Node.js 18+ and an already installed/authenticated Codex CLI, executes the same
Workflow JavaScript, and delegates only `agent()` leaves to `codex exec`.

Codex settings are `GEAK_CODEX_BIN`, `GEAK_NODE_BIN`, `GEAK_CODEX_MODEL`,
`GEAK_CODEX_MAX_AGENTS`, `GEAK_CODEX_SANDBOX`, `GEAK_CODEX_BYPASS`,
`GEAK_CODEX_ADD_DIRS`, and `GEAK_CODEX_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS`. The adapter probes required CLI flags. Normal mode
uses `--approve-for-me`; bypass mode is only for externally isolated GPU runners. GEAK does not install or
authenticate Codex.

## `handoff.json` (caller → workflow)

Pass the following fields in the handoff file.

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "model_path": "/models/Qwen-Qwen3.5-27B",
  "framework": "sglang",                 // -> backend (sglang|vllm)
  "gpu_type": "MI300X",
  "tp": 8,                               // serving tensor-parallel size (honoured, no TP=1 lock)
  "gpu_ids": "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7",          // optional; default 0..tp-1
  "workload": { "isl": 1024, "osl": 1024, "conc": 64 },
  "accepted_flags": "--attention-backend triton",  // best config from the caller's search
  "accepted_env": "SGLANG_USE_AITER=1",
  "launch_recipe": "/path/baseline_config.with_envs.yaml",  // optional launch script/recipe
  "raw_baseline_tput": 1485.4,           // caller's pre-change session baseline (audit reference)
  "orchestrator_best_tput_same_config": 1550.8, // caller best measured with accepted_flags/env
  "exp_root": "/work/experiment/geak",   // basename MUST be `geak`; the timestamped run dir is created here
  "bench_client": "auto",                // auto|inferencex|native
  "inferencex_path": "/opt/InferenceX",  // optional; else taken from $INFERENCEX_PATH
  "bench_protocol": {                    // optional; caller's measurement calibration
    "random_range_ratio": 0,             //   fixed(0) vs variable(>0) sequence lengths
    "num_prompts": 192,
    "num_warmups": 8,
    "seed": 0
  }
}
```

Required: `model_path`, `exp_root`. Everything else has a default.

`bench_protocol` is optional and partial-friendly: only the keys present are
applied. Omit it entirely (standalone GEAK, no external orchestrator) and
`bench_e2e.sh` keeps its own defaults unchanged. When the caller supplies it,
those values are the exact knobs the caller's official baseline was measured
with — forwarding them is what makes the workflow's numbers cross-harness
comparable. The `random_range_ratio` convention is `0` for fixed-length and
`>0` for variable-length (lengths sampled in `[(1-ratio)*len, (1+ratio)*len]`);
a silent mismatch between the caller's value and the standalone default causes a
roughly 10-15% calibration gap. Both default to `0` (fixed) so the standalone
and forwarded calibrations agree unless the caller requests variable lengths.

### How handoff maps to the workflow

The mapping is owned by `run_e2e.py:map_args`.

| handoff field | `e2e_workflow.js` arg | note |
|---|---|---|
| `model_path` | `model_path` | required |
| `framework` | `backend` | `sglang` or `vllm` |
| `tp` | `tp` | serving tensor-parallel (threaded to bench `TP`) |
| `gpu_ids` or `tp` | `gpu_ids` | defaults to `0..tp-1` |
| `workload.{isl,osl,conc}` | `isl`, `osl`, `conc` | profile and bench workload |
| `accepted_flags` | `initial_extra_server_args` | seeds the baseline from caller best config |
| `accepted_env` | `initial_extra_env` | seeds baseline env |
| `launch_recipe` | `launch_script` | optional |
| `raw_baseline_tput` | result audit metadata | pre-change session baseline; never used as the measurement-alignment signal |
| `orchestrator_best_tput_same_config` | result alignment metadata | caller throughput on the accepted config GEAK uses for its baseline |
| `exp_root` | `exp_root` | run dir root |
| (derived from `exp_root`) | `tracelens` | auto-discovered upstream TraceLens artifacts; only non-null paths forwarded; key omitted entirely when none found |
| `bench_client`, `inferencex_path` | env `BENCH_CLIENT`, `INFERENCEX_PATH` | exported so every `bench_e2e.sh` call inherits it (not a JS arg) |
| `bench_protocol.*` | env `RANDOM_RANGE_RATIO`, `NUM_PROMPTS`, `NUM_WARMUPS`, `SEED` | `run_e2e.py:apply_bench_protocol` exports only the provided keys; absent keys keep `bench_e2e.sh` defaults |
| — | `config_tune="false"` | caller already did config search; not repeated |
| — | `apply_to_original="true"` | `final/final_launch.sh` and overlay are emitted for sweep reuse |

### TraceLens prior autodiscovery

Owned by `run_e2e.py:resolve_tracelens_report`. An upstream orchestrator might have
already profiled the same baseline workload with TraceLens and dropped its
artifacts beside the handoff's `geak` directory (under the experiment root, which
is the parent of `geak`). `map_args` resolves them by glob and forwards the
non-null paths to the workflow as `args.tracelens`.

| key | glob (relative to the experiment root) | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `analysis_md` | `kernel-agent/**/tracelens/analysis.md` | human TraceLens hot-kernel report |
| `kernel_candidates_json` | `kernel-agent/**/kernel_candidates.json` | machine-readable hot-kernel list |
| `tracelens_report_json` | `kernel-agent/**/tracelens/tracelens_report.json` | full TraceLens report |
| `trace_file` | `runs/roofline/**/torch_trace` | roofline torch-trace directory (per-TP-rank `*.pt.trace.json.gz`) |

Resolution prefers the parent of the `geak` segment in `exp_root`; if that path
is not present it falls back to the on-disk grandparent of the handoff file.

When `analysis_md` exists, the Profiler skips its own warm-server trace
collection and builds the standardized Top-N from the TraceLens artifacts. When
`trace_file` also exists, an additional `parse_profile.py` pass recovers real
kernel symbols and reliable per-launch shapes. The System Architect uses
`kernel_candidates.json` as an advisory routing prior without overriding the
measured `%gpu`. A run without TraceLens artifacts is byte-identical to a run with
them: the feature is entirely additive.

## `result.json` (workflow → caller)

The workflow writes the following fields to the result file.

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "status": "ok | no_gain | error",
  "eval_dir": "/work/experiment/geak/e2e_<model>_<ts>",
  "baseline_throughput_tok_s": 1485.4,
  "final_throughput_tok_s": 1551.4,
  "throughput_speedup": 1.044,
  "output_parity": "pass | fail | n/a | unknown",
  "ttft_ms": 3598.0,
  "tpot_ms": 39.5,
  "final_launch_script": ".../final/final_launch.sh",
  "bench_script": ".../bench_e2e.sh",
  "final_patch": ".../final/final_patch.diff",
  "final_overlay": ".../final/overlay",
  "metric_basis": "aggregate_output_tok_s",
  "bench_client": "inferencex",
  "validated_regimes": [ { "isl": 1024, "osl": 1024, "conc": 64 } ],
  "accepted_kernels": [ /* per-kernel detail */ ],
  "accepted_heads": [ /* head GEMM/attention winners */ ],
  "accepted_config": { "flags": "...", "env": "..." },
  "baseline_basis": {
    "geak_measured_baseline_tok_s": 1551.4,
    "orchestrator_baseline_tok_s": 1485.4,
    "raw_session_baseline_divergence_pct": 4.44,
    "orchestrator_best_tput_same_config": 1550.8,
    "current_best_same_config_divergence_pct": 0.04,
    "measurement_divergence_pct": 0.04
  },
  "baseline_alignment": {
    "status": "aligned | warning | unavailable",
    "primary_metric": "current_best_same_config_divergence_pct",
    "divergence_pct": 0.04,
    "warning_threshold_pct": 3.0,
    "raw_session_divergence_is_measurement_signal": false
  },
  "report_path": ".../final_report.md",
  "kernel_journey_path": ".../kernel_journey.json",
  "recovered_from_disk": true
}
```

Schema v2 renames `baseline_divergence_pct` to
`raw_session_baseline_divergence_pct`. The raw-session metric is audit-only
because it includes accepted upstream configuration gains.

`current_best_same_config_divergence_pct` is the primary cross-harness
alignment metric. `measurement_divergence_pct` remains an exact compatibility
alias for existing callers. If `orchestrator_best_tput_same_config` is absent,
the same-config fields are `null` and `baseline_alignment.status` is
`unavailable`; GEAK never treats raw-session divergence as measurement drift.

## Handoff resilience

The workflow return (the JSON object carrying `eval_dir` and `accepted_*`) is the
only value scraped from the agent transcript. A failed scrape previously discarded
the entire run as `workflow_parse_error` even when every artifact
(`director_e2e_validation.json`, the `final/` bundle, the measured gain) was on
disk. `run_e2e.py` removes that fragility in four layers:

1. **Robust capture** — the SDK path accumulates the full transcript (every text
   fragment from every message, including tool-result blocks), not just the last
   assistant text.
2. **Robust extraction** — the parser scans the whole transcript for the last JSON
   object carrying `eval_dir` (tolerates compact single-line, fenced, pretty-printed
   multi-line, and trailing prose).
3. **On-disk sentinel** — on success the parsed return is persisted to
   `<eval_dir>/workflow_return.json`, so any later read never re-scrapes.
4. **Disk recovery** — if capture or extraction still fails (or the run timed out
   after the measured leg), the return is rebuilt from on-disk artifacts:
   `workflow_return.json` if present, else reconstructed from
   `director_e2e_validation.json` with accepted-kernel names recovered from the
   stable `overlay/cand_*` layout. Recovery returns nothing only when no completed
   `eval_dir` exists. Recovered runs set `result.recovered_from_disk = true`.

## `kernel_journey.json`

`run_e2e.py` emits `<eval_dir>/kernel_journey.json` (path echoed in
`result.kernel_journey_path`) so GEAK-authored kernels are visible in the
orchestrator's kernel-journey view. Its per-kernel sub-objects are shaped exactly
as the orchestrator recorder's `record_kernel_{dispatch,backend_result,e2e}`
inputs, so the orchestrator replays them verbatim.

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "producer": "kernel-agent",
  "eval_dir": ".../e2e_<model>_<ts>",
  "versions": { "geak": { "tool": "geak", "root_dir": "...", "commit": "<sha>", "version": "<sha>" } },
  "kernels": [
    {
      "kernel_id": "int4_w4a16_fused_moe_grouped_gemm",
      "name": "int4_w4a16_fused_moe_grouped_gemm",
      "gpu_pct": 0.57,
      "dispatch":       { "dispatched": true, "backends": ["geak"], "skip_reason": "", "task_group": null },
      "backend_result": { "kernel_id": "...", "run_id": "...", "attempts": [ { "backend": "geak", "attempt_id": "...", "status": "succeeded", "decision": "KEEP", "micro_speedup": 1.6316, "compile_passed": true, "correctness_passed": true, "optimized_path": ".../final_patch.diff", "error": null, "error_type": null } ], "verification": { "micro_speedup": 1.6316, "best_attempt_id": "...", "best_backend": "geak" }, "metadata": { "root_dir": "...", "version": "<sha>" } },
      "e2e":            { "integrated": true, "e2e_gain_pct": 12.21, "validated": true, "decision": "KEEP", "patch_path": ".../final_patch.diff", "target_file": null, "extra_server_args": "--kv-cache-dtype fp8" }
    }
  ]
}
```

On the recovery path, per-kernel `micro_speedup` might be `null` (it only existed
in the scraped return) — it is never fabricated; but when exactly one kernel was
accepted it is credited with the whole measured e2e delta.

## Reusing deliverables for a workload sweep

`final_launch.sh` is self-contained (it bakes `OVERLAY_PYTHONPATH`, accepted
flags and env, `BACKEND`, `TP`) and delegates server launch and bench to
`bench_e2e.sh`. To sweep workloads on the optimized server without rebuilding
the overlay:

1. Start the optimized server once using `final_launch.sh`.
2. For each `(CONC, ISL, OSL)` point, call `bench_e2e.sh` with
   `REUSE_SERVER=1 CONC=.. ISL=.. OSL=..` against the warm server.
3. For any point outside `validated_regimes`, redo a greedy output parity probe
   (the kernels were only validated at the single handoff workload point).

## Measurement alignment

The workflow measures on the same calibration as the caller's official baseline so
`final` and sweep curves are comparable to the caller's raw baseline.

| knob | aligned value |
|---|---|
| primary metric | aggregate `output_throughput` (output tok/s, not per-GPU) |
| latency | `ttft_ms` and `tpot_ms` median |
| dataset | `random`; `random_range_ratio` from `handoff.bench_protocol.random_range_ratio` (caller-driven: `0`=fixed, `>0`=variable), else standalone default `0` (fixed) |
| workload | same `ISL/OSL/CONC`; `NUM_PROMPTS` from `bench_protocol.num_prompts`, else `max(CONC*factor, CONC)` |
| warmups | `NUM_WARMUPS` from `bench_protocol.num_warmups`, else `min(CONC, 8)` |
| seed | `SEED` from `bench_protocol.seed`, else fixed `0` |
| TP | same tensor-parallel (TP) size as the caller (no TP=1 lock) |
| parity | greedy output diff vs baseline at temperature 0 with fixed seed |
| bench client | `BENCH_CLIENT=inferencex` uses the same `benchmark_serving.py` as Hyperloom |

The serving stack is always launched by the backend adapter
(`adapters/sglang.sh` or `vllm.sh`). The bench client is selected independently
by `BENCH_CLIENT`:

- `native` (default standalone): each backend's built-in bench
  (`sglang.bench_serving` or vLLM). A small cross-harness difference remains.
- `inferencex`: `adapters/clients/inferencex.sh` redefines `adapter_bench` to
  call Hyperloom's own `benchmark_serving.py`, which is byte-for-byte the same
  client Hyperloom uses.

`run_e2e.py` resolves `handoff.bench_client` (`auto` maps to `inferencex` when
an InferenceX checkout is discoverable using `INFERENCEX_PATH`, else `native`)
and exports `BENCH_CLIENT` and `INFERENCEX_PATH` so every `bench_e2e.sh` the
agents run inherits them.
