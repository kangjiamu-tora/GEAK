# What is GEAK?

GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-Centric Kernels) is a multi-agent GPU performance optimizer for AMD
Instinct™ MI GPUs (CDNA; the on-box card is auto-detected). It ships two deterministic Workflows,
driven by Claude Code by default, or by Codex through the thin adapter:

| Workflow | Scope | What it optimizes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`e2e_workflow`** (Recommended) | Whole-model serving | End-to-end sglang or vLLM throughput of a full LLM |
| `kernel_workflow` | Single kernel | Latency or speedup of one AMD GPU kernel (Triton, HIP, CK, FlyDSL) |

`e2e_workflow` is the headline: it raises serving throughput by triaging hot kernels and pulling levers
cheapest-first, then *recursively* calls `kernel_workflow` to author or optimize the kernels worth
fixing. To speed up a single kernel, use `kernel_workflow` directly.

## Core design: deterministic control plane, LLM judgment

Control flow — the budget loop, parallel fan-out, verification, and stop conditions — is deterministic
JS in `e2e_workflow.js` / `kernel_workflow.js`. LLM agents are invoked only for judgment (analysis,
strategy, kernel authoring). This makes runs reliable and reproducible.

### e2e_workflow (whole-model serving)

A system layer that wraps — and recursively calls — the single-kernel layer. Specialized agents own each
stage: an e2e Director (isolated environment + true baseline), a System Architect (Amdahl
strategy), a Profiler, a Config Tuner, a Kernel Extractor, an Op Benchmarker, and an
e2e Integrator (reversible overlay + throughput gate).

### kernel_workflow (single kernel)

A hierarchical single-kernel optimizer: Director → TechLead → specialist engineers (algorithm,
memory, compute, host-runtime), multi-round and budget-controlled. Each patch is independently verified
against an immutable correctness oracle before it is accepted.

## Accuracy and measurement

- **Profiling** grounds every decision in measured data — nothing is optimized unless it is first shown
  to matter (Amdahl: `pct_gpu_time × achievable_speedup`).
- **A curated knowledge base** (`perf_knowledge/`) supplies operator × backend priors as *reference
  only* — the on-box benchmark and end-to-end gate are always the judge.

## How a run works

1. **Preflight** the environment (GPU arch, serving backend, model).
2. **Profile** a running server on your exact workload and rank hot kernels by Amdahl.
3. **Pull levers cheapest-first** — config/backend sweep → head GEMM/attention bake-off (aiter per-shape
   tune + a kernel *authored* using the recursive kernel layer) → editable-kernel milestone loop.
4. **Overlay** each accepted change back reversibly, gated on a measured warm-server throughput delta
   (interleaved A/B, output parity).
5. **Report and validate** — every run writes a complete `final_report.md`, and the Director independently
   re-measures the result.
