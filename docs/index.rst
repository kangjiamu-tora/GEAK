GEAK documentation
==================

GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-Centric Kernels) is a multi-agent GPU performance optimizer for
AMD Instinct™ MI GPUs (CDNA). It ships two deterministic Workflows: ``e2e_workflow`` raises the
end-to-end sglang or vLLM serving throughput of a whole model, and ``kernel_workflow`` optimizes a
single AMD GPU kernel (Triton, HIP, CK, FlyDSL). Control flow is deterministic JS; LLM agents are called
only for judgment. Claude Code is the default agent backend, with Codex available through a thin adapter.

The GEAK public repository is located at `AMD-AGI/GEAK <https://github.com/AMD-AGI/GEAK>`_.
