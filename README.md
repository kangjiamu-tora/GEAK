GEAK is an autonomous optimization agent that makes AMD Instinct GPUs run faster, automatically. Built as a
multi-agent system with an evolving knowledge base, it learns from every optimization run and continuously
improves its strategies over time. Point it at a single kernel or a live model-serving stack such as vLLM or
sglang, and GEAK runs the full optimization loop: it finds the bottlenecks, generates and tunes better kernels
across paths such as Triton, FlyDSL, TileLang, and HIP, and validates the speedup on the real system. What
normally takes weeks of expert kernel engineering becomes an automated, repeatable, and self-improving process.

GEAK targets AMD Instinct MI GPUs (CDNA, e.g. gfx942 / gfx950; the on-box card is auto-detected). Deterministic
JS Workflows own control flow, with Claude Code as the default agent backend and Codex available through a
thin adapter. It ships two workflows, each for a different scenario:

| Workflow | Scope | What it optimizes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [e2e_workflow](e2e_workflow/) | Whole-model serving | End-to-end sglang / vLLM throughput of a full LLM |
| [kernel_workflow](kernel_workflow/) | Single kernel | Latency / speedup of a single AMD GPU kernel (Triton, HIP, CK, FlyDSL, …) |

Use e2e_workflow to raise a whole model's serving throughput: it triages hot kernels, pulls the cheapest levers
first, and recursively calls kernel_workflow for the kernels worth fixing. Use kernel_workflow on its own to
optimize a single kernel.

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

- An **AMD Instinct MI GPU** (CDNA, e.g. gfx942 / gfx950), **ROCm 6+**, a profiler (`rocprof-compute` /
  `rocprofv3` / `rocprof`), Python 3.8+.
- For E2E: a running-capable serving backend (`sglang` or `vllm`) and the model weights on disk.
- For the optional Codex backend: Node.js 18+ and a separately installed and authenticated `codex` CLI.

> **⚠️ Build your kernel environment first.** GEAK does **not** install the toolchains your kernels
> need (e.g. PyTorch, Triton, FlyDSL, hipBLASLt) — these differ per kernel. Set up and verify the
> baseline builds/runs before starting a workflow.

### 2. Set up

Installing GEAK does three things: installs the `geak` Python package + deps, clones the GEAK repo, and installs
the Claude Code CLI. By default the repo lands in `./GEAK` under the directory you run the command from (override
the location with `GEAK_HOME`). Pick either method — both end up the same:

Claude remains the default backend. The installer does not install or authenticate Codex.

**A. One-liner** — run it in the directory where you want GEAK to live:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/AMD-AGI/GEAK"
```

**B. Clone first** — if you'd rather have the checkout up front (e.g. to work on a branch):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMD-AGI/GEAK.git
cd GEAK
pip install .
```

### 3. Launch Claude Code in auto mode

**Set up PATH and API access**

You'll need to add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH and configure API access yourself — follow the installer's printed next-steps:

```bash
# Option 1: Anthropic API directly
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Option 2: Standard gateway (x-api-key / bearer)
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-gateway
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
```

> If your gateway authenticates with a **custom header** instead of `x-api-key` / a bearer token
> (e.g. `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`), set it via `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`:
> ```bash
> export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-gateway
> export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS="Your-Header-Name: <your-key>"
> ```

**Launch Claude Code**

The workflows spawn many sub-agents and run profiling / benchmark / build commands on the box, so run
Claude Code with permissions auto-approved (≥ 2.1.177 for the dynamic Workflow feature):

```bash
IS_SANDBOX=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Then just describe what you want in natural language (examples below). Claude Code resolves the paths and
invokes the `Workflow` tool for you.

### Optional: use Codex for `run_e2e.py`

After installing and authenticating Codex separately, select it for the stable external interface:

```bash
node --version                    # must be 18+
codex exec --help
export GEAK_AGENT_BACKEND=codex
python interface/run_e2e.py handoff.json result.json
```

The existing workflow JavaScript and roles are unchanged. The Node runtime executes their deterministic control
flow and starts one `codex exec` process for each `agent()` leaf. See
[`interface/codex_workflow/README.md`](interface/codex_workflow/README.md) for sandbox, concurrency, model,
timeout, and writable-directory configuration.

## e2e_workflow — whole-model serving throughput ⭐

`e2e_workflow/` raises the **sglang / vLLM serving throughput** of a whole LLM. It is a *system layer*
that wraps — and recursively calls — the single-kernel kernel_workflow:

1. **Preflight** the env (GPU arch, backend, model).
2. **Profile** a running server on your exact workload.
3. **Triage** hot kernels by **Amdahl** (`pct_gpu_time × achievable_speedup`).
4. **Pull levers cheapest-first** — config/backend sweep → head GEMM/attention bake-off (aiter per-shape
   tune + a kernel *authored* via the recursive kernel layer, FlyDSL-first for GEMM) → editable-kernel
   milestone loop.
5. **Overlay** each accepted change back **reversibly**, gated on a measured warm-server throughput delta
   (interleaved A/B, 0.5% band + engagement proof + output parity).

Every run writes a complete **`final_report.md`** (with a Phases tree + artifacts tree).

### Example

```
use path_to_GEAK/e2e_workflow to optimize inference for /models/Qwen3.5-27B-FP8, sglang, ISL/OSL=1024, conc=64, gpus 0,1,2,3
```

**Output** lands under `e2e_workflow/exp/e2e_<model>_<timestamp>/` — `final_report.md`,
`architect_report.md`, `final/` (overlay + patch + `final_launch.sh`), and per-stage artifacts.

---

## kernel_workflow — single kernel

`kernel_workflow/` optimizes a single AMD GPU kernel — Triton, HIP, CK, FlyDSL, or any AMD GPU source:
Director → TechLead → specialist engineers (algorithm / memory / compute / host_runtime), multi-round and
budget-controlled, with each patch independently verified before it's accepted.

### Example

```
use path_to_GEAK/kernel_workflow to optimize path_to_GEAK/examples/tasks/knn
```

```
use path_to_GEAK/kernel_workflow to optimize /path/to/silu, budget 8, focus on wrapper overhead
```

### Batch (many kernels at once)

Spawn one agent per kernel with isolated GPU assignments; GPU access is serialized via
`scripts/gpu_lock.sh` (flock-based), so kernels can safely share GPUs.

---

## Why Workflows

Control flow — the budget loop, fan-out, verification, and stop conditions — is **deterministic JS** in
`kernel_workflow.js` / `e2e_workflow.js`. LLM agents are called only for judgement (analysis, strategy,
optimization). Both agent backends execute this same JavaScript rather than interpreting it.

## Results — single-kernel

12 HIP kernels, measured on AMD MI300X (gfx942) (excluding mla_decode; FAIL counted as 1.0x):

| Method | LLM | Geo Mean |
| ------ | --- | -------- |
| GEAK_v3 (baseline) | Opus 4.8 | 1.90x |
| **kernel_workflow** | Opus 4.8 | **3.68x** |
