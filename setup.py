"""Build-time hook for GEAK — all metadata + deps live in pyproject.toml.

The only reason setup.py still exists: a PEP 621 [project] table can't express a
build-time hook, and GEAK needs one so that

    pip install git+https://github.com/AMD-AGI/GEAK

runs a best-effort bootstrap during the wheel build (clone the full repo to
$GEAK_HOME + install the default Claude Code CLI). The optional Codex backend
is never installed or authenticated automatically. The logic lives in
geak/bootstrap.py.

The hook fires only on a real wheel build; if pip serves a cached wheel it is
skipped, so force a rebuild with `pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall`
if the clone / Claude Code steps did not run.

Set GEAK_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1 to build/install the package without side effects
(CI, docker image builds, or using geak purely as a library dependency).
